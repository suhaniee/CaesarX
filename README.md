# CaesarX
CaesarX is a simple Python program that lets you encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar cipher. It shifts each letter of your message by a key value to create a coded text. The program supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, keeps symbols unchanged, and works even if the shift number is larger than 26.
