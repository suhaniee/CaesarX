# CaesarX
CaesarX is a simple Python program that lets you encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar cipher. It shifts each letter of your message by a key value to create a coded text. The program supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, keeps symbols unchanged, and works even if the shift number is larger than 26.

A basic Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher.

How it works

The program shifts each letter in your message by a number (the shift key).
If you choose to decrypt, it shifts letters back by the same amount.
Non-alphabet characters like spaces or punctuation stay the same.

Example
Type 1 to encrypt or 2 to decrypt the message : 1
Type your message : Hello World!
Enter shift key : 3
Output : Khoor Zruog!
